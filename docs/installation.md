# üì¶ Installation Guide

This guide covers different ways to install Beacon Delivery Compass, with best practices for maintaining a clean Python development environment.

## üèÅ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8** or higher
- **Git 2.0** or higher (for repository analysis)
- **pip** 21.0 or higher (Python package installer)
- **GitPython** 3.1.0+ (automatically installed as a dependency)

Verify your Python installation:
```bash
python --version  # or python3 --version
```

## üöÄ Recommended Installation (Virtual Environment)

### 1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows (Command Prompt):
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

You'll know the virtual environment is active when you see `(.venv)` in your terminal prompt.

### 2. Install Beacon Delivery Compass

```bash
# Install the latest stable version from PyPI with all optional dependencies
pip install 'beaconled[all]'

# For minimal installation (core functionality only)
# pip install beaconled

# Verify installation
beaconled --version
```
