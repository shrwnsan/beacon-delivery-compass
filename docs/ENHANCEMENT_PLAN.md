# Beacon Delivery Compass - Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines potential improvements and enhancements for the Beacon Delivery Compass project, organized by category and priority.

## 1. Documentation Updates ✅
### High Priority
- [x] Add comprehensive examples of date formats to README
- [x] Update CLI help text with detailed examples and usage patterns
- [x] Document date parsing behavior and supported formats in code docstrings

### Medium Priority ✅
- [x] Create a user guide for common workflows
- [x] Add API documentation for core modules

## 2. Error Handling
### High Priority
- [ ] Improve error messages for invalid date formats
- [ ] Add input validation for date ranges (end date after start date)
- [ ] Ensure consistent error handling patterns across the codebase

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add custom exception classes for different error types
- [ ] Implement more granular error codes for programmatic handling

## 3. Testing
### High Priority
- [ ] Add edge case tests for date parsing
- [ ] Test invalid date format scenarios
- [ ] Expand CLI integration tests with various date formats

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Add property-based testing for date parsing
- [ ] Test with different timezones and DST transitions
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for large repositories

## 4. Code Quality
### High Priority
- [ ] Complete type hints for all functions and methods
- [ ] Refactor date parsing logic into a dedicated utility class
- [ ] Increase test coverage to 90%+

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Implement static type checking in CI
- [ ] Add code quality checks (flake8, black, isort)
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting

## 5. User Experience
### High Priority
- [ ] Add `--list-formats` flag to display supported date formats
- [ ] Implement progress indicators for long-running operations
- [ ] Add colorized output for better readability

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Support additional relative date formats (e.g., "yesterday", "last week")
- [ ] Add interactive mode for guided usage
- [ ] Implement output formatting options (CSV, JSON, table)

## 6. Performance
### Medium Priority
- [ ] Optimize git operations for large repositories
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed repository data
- [ ] Implement parallel processing for independent operations

## 7. Technical Debt
### High Priority
- [ ] Remove deprecated code paths
- [ ] Update dependencies to latest stable versions
- [ ] Address all TODO/FIXME comments in code

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with high-priority items that provide the most value to users
2. Address technical debt to maintain code health
3. Implement features in small, testable increments
4. Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality

## Success Metrics
- Improved test coverage to 90%+
- Reduced number of open issues
- Positive user feedback on improved error messages and documentation
- Faster execution time for common operations
