# Beacon Delivery Compass â€” For Product Leaders

Drive outcomes with engineering reality. Beacon turns Git activity into actionable insights you can use to run weekly product reviews, align roadmaps, and forecast delivery.

Who this is for:
- Product Managers and Leads
- Heads of Engineering / CTOs
- Program Managers and Analytics Leads

What you get in 10 minutes:
- Clear delivery signals (velocity, scope churn, impact)
- Weekly-ready product review report
- KPIs that tie engineering activity to product outcomes

Start here:
- View a sample Weekly Report (no install): ./samples/weekly_report.txt and ./samples/weekly_report.json
- Interpret the signals (PM guide): ./ANALYTICS_DASHBOARD.md
- Ask an engineer to generate a live report: ./delivery/quickstart.md
- Full Usage (engineers): ./delivery/usage.md
- Installation: ./installation.md

Why Beacon
- Truth from source: uses your Git historyâ€”no manual status collecting
- Weekly cadence by default: equips product rituals, not replaces them
- Lightweight: single binary CLI, JSON output for BI/automation

Core Outcomes
- Visibility: changes, impact, and risk movement per week
- Predictability: trend lines for planning and capacity
- Accountability: decisions anchored in code reality

Key Concepts
- Commit Analytics: who/what/how much changed
- Impact: file/component-level influence scoring
- Range Analytics: period-based metrics (e.g., sprint, week)
