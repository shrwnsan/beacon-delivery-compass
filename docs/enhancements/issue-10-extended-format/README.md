## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for Issue #10, which aims to enhance the `--format extended` output with more detailed analytics and insights. The enhancement will transform the current basic extended format into a powerful analytics tool providing deep insights into repository activity, team collaboration, and code quality metrics.

## 📋 Current State Analysis

### Existing ExtendedFormatter Capabilities
The current `ExtendedFormatter` class provides:
- Basic file type breakdown in commit stats
- Author contribution details in range stats
- Daily activity patterns (partially implemented)
- Color-coded output using colorama
- Simple statistical summaries

### Gap Analysis
Compared to the requirements in Issue #10, the current implementation lacks:
- Time-based analysis (commit frequency heatmaps, velocity trends)
- Code quality metrics (churn, complexity, risk indicators)
- Enhanced file analysis (lifecycle tracking, frequently changed files)
- Team collaboration insights (co-authorship, knowledge silos)
- Rich output formatting (ASCII charts, risk indicators, emojis)

## 🎯 Enhancement Objectives

### 1. Time-based Analysis
- **Commit frequency heatmap** by day of week and hour
- **Bus factor calculation** and key contributor identification
- **Commit velocity trends** over time periods
- **Peak activity period** highlighting

### 2. Code Quality Metrics
- **Code churn metrics** (added/deleted lines ratio)
- **File complexity trends** tracking
- **Large/risky change** identification
- **Test coverage changes** (if available from git history)

### 3. Enhanced File Analysis
- **Largest file changes** highlighting
- **File type distribution** visualization
- **File lifecycle tracking** (new, modified, deleted)
- **Frequently changed files** identification

### 4. Team Collaboration
- **Co-authorship patterns** analysis
- **Review metrics** extraction from git history
- **Code ownership patterns** mapping
- **Knowledge silos** identification

### 5. Output Format Improvements
- **ASCII charts** for trend visualization
- **Summary statistics** with key insights
- **Color-coded risk indicators**
- **Improved section organization** with emojis and clear hierarchy

## 📝 Implementation Tasks

The implementation is broken down into **12 independent tasks** that can be developed in parallel using git worktree. Each task is designed to be self-contained and can be worked on by junior engineers independently.

### Task Categories

#### Core Analytics (Tasks 1-4)
1. **Time-Based Analytics Implementation**
2. **Team Collaboration Metrics**
3. **Code Quality Assessment**
4. **Risk Indicator System**

#### Visualization (Tasks 5-7)
5. **ASCII Chart Rendering Engine**
6. **Heatmap Visualization System**
7. **Trend Analysis Charts**

#### Enhanced Formatting (Tasks 8-10)
8. **Rich Output Formatter**
9. **Enhanced Section Renderers**
10. **Emoji and Color Enhancement**

#### Integration & Testing (Tasks 11-12)
11. **Integration and Testing**
12. **Documentation and Examples**

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Git Worktree Strategy
Each task will be developed in its own worktree to enable parallel development:

```bash
# Main development
git worktree add ../beacon-task-01-time-analytics issue-10/task-01-time-analytics
git worktree add ../beacon-task-02-team-metrics issue-10/task-02-team-metrics
# ... (continue for all tasks)
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Review the architecture document** (`architecture.md`)
2. **Set up git worktrees** following `workflows/git-worktree-setup.md`
3. **Choose a task** from the `tasks/` directory
4. **Follow the task-specific implementation guide**
5. **Use the integration process** when ready to merge
