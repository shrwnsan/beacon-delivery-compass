# Task Assignment and Tracking System

## Overview

This document outlines the system for assigning, tracking, and managing the 12 parallel development tasks for Issue #10. It ensures efficient coordination, prevents conflicts, and maintains visibility across the development team.

## Task Assignment Process

### 1. Task Selection

Tasks are self-assigned using the following process:

#### Available Tasks Status
Track task assignments using this table (update in real-time):

| Task ID | Title | Status | Assignee | Start Date | Target Completion |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Task 01 | Time-Based Analytics | Available | - | - | - |
| Task 02 | Team Collaboration Metrics | Available | - | - | - |
| Task 03 | Code Quality Assessment | Available | - | - | - |
| Task 04 | Risk Indicator System | Available | - | - | - |
| Task 05 | ASCII Chart Rendering | Available | - | - | - |
| Task 06 | Heatmap Visualization | Available | - | - | - |
| Task 07 | Trend Analysis Charts | Available | - | - | - |
| Task 08 | Rich Output Formatter | Available | - | - | - |
| Task 09 | Enhanced Section Renderers | Available | - | - | - |
| Task 10 | Emoji and Color Enhancement | Available | - | - | - |
| Task 11 | Integration and Testing | Available | - | - | - |
| Task 12 | Documentation and Examples | Available | - | - | - |

### 2. Claiming a Task

To claim a task:

1. **Check dependencies** in the task specification document
2. **Announce your intention** in the team communication channel
3. **Update the tracking table** above
4. **Create assignment marker** in your worktree:

```bash
# Navigate to task worktree
cd ../beacon-task-01-time-analytics

# Create assignment file
cat > .task-assignment << EOF
Developer: Your Name
Email: your.email@domain.com
Started: $(date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
Dependencies: None
Estimated Completion: $(date -d "+1 week" +"%Y-%m-%d")
EOF

# Commit the assignment
git add .task-assignment
git commit -m "docs: claim task 01 - time-based analytics"
git push origin issue-10/task-01-time-analytics
```

### 3. Task Dependencies

Some tasks have dependencies that must be respected:

#### Dependency Graph
```
Task 01 (Time Analytics) ──┐
                           ├─► Task 08 (Rich Formatter)
Task 02 (Team Metrics) ────┤
                           │
Task 03 (Quality Assessment)┘

Task 05 (ASCII Charts) ──┐
                         ├─► Task 06 (Heatmaps)
                         └─► Task 07 (Trends)

Task 08 (Rich Formatter) ──► Task 09 (Section Renderers)

All Core Tasks ──► Task 11 (Integration)
Task 11 ──► Task 12 (Documentation)
```

#### Dependency Rules
- **Parallel Development**: Tasks without dependencies can start immediately
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Wait for dependency completion before starting
- **Soft Dependencies**: Can start with mock interfaces, update when dependency completes

## Progress Tracking

### 1. Status Updates

Use standardized status markers in commit messages:

```bash
# Starting work
git commit -m "start: begin task 01 implementation"

# Progress updates
git commit -m "progress: 25% - basic time analyzer structure"
git commit -m "progress: 50% - velocity calculation complete"
git commit -m "progress: 75% - heatmap generation working"

# Completion
git commit -m "complete: task 01 implementation finished"

# Ready for review
git commit -m "review: task 01 ready for integration"
```

### 2. Daily Standups

Each developer provides updates using this format:

**Template:**
```
Task: [Task Number and Name]
Progress: [Percentage or milestone]
Completed Yesterday: [Specific accomplishments]
Planning Today: [Specific goals]
Blockers: [Any impediments or dependencies]
```

**Example:**
```
Task: 01 - Time-Based Analytics
Progress: 60%
Completed Yesterday:
  - Implemented velocity calculation algorithm
  - Added unit tests for time analyzer core
Planning Today:
  - Complete activity heatmap generation
  - Add integration tests
Blockers: Need sample data for testing peak period detection
```

### 3. Weekly Progress Reports

Each Friday, update the master tracking table:

```markdown
## Week of [Date] Progress Report

### Completed Tasks
- Task 05: ASCII Chart Rendering (Developer: Alice)
- Task 10: Emoji Enhancement (Developer: Bob)

### In Progress Tasks
- Task 01: Time Analytics - 75% (Developer: Charlie)
- Task 02: Team Metrics - 40% (Developer: Diana)

### Upcoming Tasks
- Task 08: Rich Formatter (depends on Tasks 1-3)
- Task 11: Integration (depends on core tasks)

### Issues/Blockers
- Task 03: Waiting for code quality metrics specification
- Task 06: Dependency on Task 05 completion
```

- **Scope creep**: Strict adherence to task specifications, change control process

#### Process Risks
- **Developer unavailability**: Cross-training, documentation requirements
- **Dependency delays**: Mock interfaces, parallel development strategies
- **Quality issues**: Rigorous code review, automated testing

### 2. Escalation Process

#### Level 1: Self-Resolution (0-1 days)
- Try alternative approaches
- Consult documentation and examples
- Search for similar issues in codebase

#### Level 2: Peer Assistance (1-2 days)
- Reach out to team members
- Request code review of approach
- Pair programming session

#### Level 3: Technical Lead (2-3 days)
- Escalate to tech lead
- Review task scope and requirements
- Consider architectural changes

#### Level 4: Project Manager (3+ days)
