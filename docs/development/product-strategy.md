# Product Strategy: Built-in Health Reports

*Strategic vision for transitioning from custom scripts to native product delivery health features*

## Executive Summary

Beacon Delivery Compass has validated significant demand for built-in product delivery health reports through comprehensive advanced usage testing. The transition from custom scripting to native features represents a strategic opportunity to establish market leadership in engineering analytics and executive reporting.

## Market Validation Evidence

### **Proven User Demand**
