# Security Roadmap

This document tracks security improvements and long-term work. It complements the top-level SECURITY.md, which is user-focused for product builders and developers.

## High Priority (Next 30 Days)
1. Enhanced Error Handling
   - Sanitize error messages to prevent information disclosure
   - Implement generic error responses for security-sensitive operations
   - Add structured logging for security events

2. Security Testing Framework
   - Add unit tests for security edge cases
   - Implement fuzzing tests for input validation
   - Create a security regression test suite

## Medium Priority (Next 90 Days)
3. Audit Logging Implementation
   - Add structured security event logging
   - Implement audit trail for all Git operations
   - Create security metrics and monitoring

4. Input Sanitization Enhancement
   - Additional output sanitization for terminal formatting
   - Enhanced validation for edge cases
   - Implement content security policies

5. Configuration Hardening
   - Add configuration validation schemas
   - Implement secure defaults for all settings
   - Enhance credential management

## Long-term (Next 6 Months)
6. Advanced Threat Protection
   - Rate limiting for Git operations
   - Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
   - Security monitoring and alerting

7. Architecture Security
   - Consider sandboxing for Git operations
   - Implement process isolation
   - Add container security if deploying as a service

## Maintenance
- Monthly dependency vulnerability review and updates
- Periodic security posture reviews aligned with releases
