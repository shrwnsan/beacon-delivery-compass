# Beacon Delivery Compass - Development Roadmap

*Last Updated: 2025-08-16*

## Overview
This document tracks the development progress and future plans for Beacon Delivery Compass, organized by priority and category.

## High Priority (Next 2-4 Weeks)

### Core Functionality
- [x] Basic Git repository analysis
- [x] Multiple output formats (JSON, standard, extended)
- [x] Basic test coverage
- [x] Basic error handling
- [x] Basic documentation

### Performance Optimizations
- [x] Migrate direct git subprocess calls to GitPython
- [x] Improve error handling for git operations
- [ ] Implement streaming for large commit ranges (Memory Management)

### Code Quality
- [x] Add comprehensive type hints
- [x] Configure mypy for static type checking
- [x] Implement custom exception classes
- [x] Standardize error messages and logging
- [ ] Increase test coverage to 90%+

## Medium Priority (Next 1-3 Months)

### Dependency Management
- [ ] Create dependency verification script
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for dependency validation

### Documentation
- [x] Update installation instructions
- [x] Add troubleshooting guide
- [x] Improve CLI help text
- [ ] Add API documentation for core modules

### Testing
- [x] Unit tests for core functionality
- [x] Edge case tests for date parsing
- [x] Test invalid date format scenarios
- [x] CLI integration tests with various date formats
- [ ] Integration tests for large repositories
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility tests

## Long-term (3-6 Months)

### Performance
- [ ] Implement parallel processing for large repositories
- [ ] Add progress indicators for long-running operations
- [ ] Benchmark key operations
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring

### User Experience
- [ ] Add `--list-formats` flag to display supported date formats
- [ ] Implement interactive shell for exploring repository statistics
- [ ] Add support for generating charts and graphs

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor date parsing logic into a dedicated utility class
- [ ] Move net change calculation to model `@property`
- [ ] Use `dateutil` for more reliable date parsing

## Security
See [Security Roadmap](./security/roadmap.md) for detailed security-related improvements.
