  - [ ] Interactive dashboards for code health trends
  - [ ] Export capabilities for presentation materials
  - [ ] Real-time health monitoring dashboards

- [ ] **Pre-built Health Templates**
  - [ ] Industry-standard health scoring algorithms
  - [ ] Configurable health thresholds per project type
  - [ ] Template library for common use cases (refactoring impact, release readiness)
  - [ ] Integration with popular development workflows

- [ ] **Advanced CLI Extensions**
  - [ ] `beaconled health` subcommand with built-in templates
  - [ ] `beaconled trends` for time-series analysis
  - [ ] `beaconled assess` for pre-release health checks
  - [ ] Export formats optimized for CI/CD integration

### Built-in Product Delivery Health Reports
*Proven valuable through advanced usage testing - transition from custom scripts to native features*

**ðŸ“Š Strategic Context**: See [Product Strategy: Built-in Health Reports](./product-strategy.md) for comprehensive market analysis, user personas, competitive differentiation, and business impact projections.

- [ ] **Executive Dashboard Generation**
  - [ ] `beaconled --executive-report` flag for instant executive summaries
  - [ ] Built-in productivity index calculations with interpretive guidance
  - [ ] Automated period-over-period comparisons
  - [ ] Export to executive-friendly formats (JSON, CSV, PDF)

- [ ] **Team Health Monitoring**
  - [ ] `beaconled --team-health` for comprehensive team analytics
  - [ ] Built-in author impact analysis with contribution rankings
  - [ ] Team velocity and workload distribution insights
  - [ ] Automated daily/weekly standup report generation

- [ ] **Release Readiness Assessment**
  - [ ] `beaconled --release-ready` with 0-100 scoring system
  - [ ] Color-coded risk assessments (ðŸŸ¢ Ready, ðŸŸ¡ Caution, ðŸ”´ Risk)
  - [ ] Automated quality gate integration for CI/CD pipelines
  - [ ] Pre-release checklist generation with actionable recommendations

- [ ] **Technical Debt Tracking**
  - [ ] `beaconled --debt-analysis` with comprehensive scoring
  - [ ] Built-in health score calculations (90-100: Excellent, 70-89: Good, etc.)
  - [ ] Automated large commit and bug fix pattern detection
  - [ ] Refactoring impact measurement and trending

- [ ] **Multi-Period Health Comparison**
  - [ ] `beaconled --compare-periods` for month-over-month analysis
  - [ ] Built-in stability index calculations and trending
  - [ ] Automated health evolution tracking
  - [ ] Visual trend indicators and improvement recommendations

*Note: These features build on the comprehensive code health examples in [advanced-usage.md](../examples/advanced-usage.md) and validated usage patterns from [test_advanced_usage.sh](../../scripts/test_advanced_usage.sh), transitioning from custom scripting to native tooling.*

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor date parsing logic into a dedicated utility class
- [ ] Move net change calculation to model `@property`
- [ ] Use `dateutil` for more reliable date parsing

## Security
See [Security Roadmap](./security/roadmap.md) for detailed security-related improvements.
