Your delivery compass for empowered product builders. Transform engineering activity into executive-ready insights and data-driven product delivery decisions.

## Quick Install

Beacon requires Python 3.10+ and Git 2.23+. We recommend installing in a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install from PyPI
pip install beaconled

# Verify installation
beaconled --version
```

## Quick Start

Analyze a git repository:
```bash
beaconled /path/to/repo
```

Generate a weekly team report:
```bash
beaconled --since 1w --until "now"
```

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Analysis
```bash
# Analyze changes in the last 3 days
beaconled --since "3d"

# Date range analysis with timezone support
beaconled --since "2025-01-01" --until "2025-01-31"

# Extended analysis with team, quality, and risk metrics
beaconled --since "2w" --format extended

# Generate visual heatmaps of commit activity (requires matplotlib)
beaconled --since "1w" --format heatmap

# Disable emoji icons for plain text output
beaconled --since "1w" --no-emoji
```

#### Extended Format Features
The extended format (`--format extended`) includes comprehensive analytics:

- **Time-Based Analytics**: Velocity trends, activity heatmaps, peak periods
- **Team Collaboration**: Co-authorship patterns, ownership distribution
- **Code Quality**: Churn metrics, complexity trends, large changes
- **Risk Assessment**: Risk indicators, hotspot detection, stability metrics
- **File Analysis**:
  - **Largest Changes**: Identify files with most modifications (additions + deletions)
  - **Frequently Changed**: Track most active files during the analysis period
  - **Lifecycle Tracking**: Monitor file operations (added/modified/deleted/renamed)

Example:
```

beaconled --since "2w"   # 2 weeks ago
beaconled --since "3m"   # 3 months ago

# Absolute dates (UTC)
beaconled --since "2025-01-15"
beaconled --since "2025-01-15 14:30"
```

## Development & Contribution

We welcome contributions! For details on how to contribute, please see our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Project Roadmap

Our development priorities and planned improvements are tracked in the [Enhancement Plan](docs/development/roadmap.md). This document provides visibility into:
- Upcoming features and improvements
- Current technical debt
- Performance optimization plans
- Testing and quality assurance goals

### Code Quality

Beacon is built with a strong focus on code quality and maintainability. We use pre-commit hooks to ensure consistent code quality across the project.

#### Pre-commit Configuration

We provide two pre-commit configurations:

1. **Development Mode** (`.pre-commit-dev.yaml`):
   - More lenient rules for local development
   - Focuses on critical issues only
   - Faster feedback loop

   ```bash
   # Setup development pre-commit hooks
   make dev-setup
   ```

2. **Production Mode** (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`):
   - Strict rules for CI/CD and production
   - Enforces all code quality standards
   - Includes all linters and formatters

   ```bash
   # Setup production pre-commit hooks
   make prod-setup
   ```

#### Key Quality Tools

- **Type Safety**: Full static type checking with [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/)
- **Code Style**: Consistent code formatting with [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/)
- **Linting**: Code quality enforcement with [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and API documentation

#### Development Workflow

1. During active development, use `dev-setup` for faster commits
2. Before pushing changes, run `prod-setup` to ensure all checks pass
3. Use `git commit --no-verify` sparingly when needed

#### Manual Checks

```bash
# Run type checking
mypy --ignore-missing-imports src/beaconled

# Run all code quality checks
make lint
```

### Testing

For contributors, run the test suite with:

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

For detailed testing options, see our [Testing Guide](docs/development/testing.md).
