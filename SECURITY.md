# Security Policy

## Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures and best practices for the Beacon Delivery Compass project. Our security implementation follows defense-in-depth principles and addresses all critical vulnerabilities identified in external security audits.

## Current Security Status

### ‚úÖ Critical Vulnerabilities Resolved

**All high-risk security issues have been successfully addressed:**

1. **Command Injection Prevention** *(Critical - RESOLVED)*
   - Comprehensive input validation for commit hashes and date parameters
   - Robust regex patterns prevent malicious command injection
   - All subprocess calls use validated, parameterized inputs
   - Added input length validation (max 100 chars for commit hashes, 50 chars for dates)

2. **Directory Traversal Protection** *(High - RESOLVED)*
   - Repository path validation using `pathlib.Path.resolve()`
   - Restricted access to current working directory boundaries
   - Mandatory `.git` directory verification
   - Path boundary enforcement prevents unauthorized file access

3. **Dependency Security Updates** *(Critical - RESOLVED)*
   - Updated `gitpython` from 3.1.0 to 3.1.41 (addresses CVE-2024-22190)
   - Updated `pydantic` from 1.8.0 to 2.7.0 (security improvements)
   - All dependencies updated to latest secure versions
   - Regular dependency vulnerability scanning implemented

4. **Configuration Security** *(Medium - RESOLVED)*
   - Comprehensive `.gitignore` rules for sensitive configuration files
   - Created `config/notifications.example.json` template
   - Environment variable usage for credentials
   - Protected against credential exposure in version control

5. **Email Security Hardening** *(Medium - RESOLVED)*
   - Email recipient validation with proper format checking
   - SMTP timeout (30s) prevents connection hanging
   - Configuration validation for webhook URLs
   - HTTPS enforcement for all external communications

6. **Process Timeout Protection** *(High - RESOLVED)*
   - 30-second timeouts on all subprocess calls
   - HTTP request timeouts prevent hanging connections
   - Input length validation prevents DoS attacks
   - SSL certificate verification for all HTTPS requests

## Security Audit Results

### External Security Assessment
An independent security audit was conducted, identifying several critical vulnerabilities. **All critical and high-risk issues have been successfully resolved**, with our implementation exceeding the audit's recommendations in most areas.

**Audit vs. Implementation Comparison:**
- **Command Injection**: Audit rated as Critical ‚Üí ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** with comprehensive validation
- **Path Traversal**: Audit rated as High Risk ‚Üí ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** with boundary enforcement  
- **Input Validation**: Audit noted as Missing ‚Üí ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED** with robust patterns
- **Dependency Security**: Audit flagged vulnerabilities ‚Üí ‚úÖ **UPDATED** to secure versions
- **Process Controls**: Not covered in audit ‚Üí ‚úÖ **ENHANCED** beyond recommendations

## Next Steps: Security Roadmap

### üö® Critical Priority (Immediate Action Required)
*No critical security issues remain unresolved.*

   - Implement generic error responses for security-sensitive operations
   - Add structured logging for security events

2. **Security Testing Framework**
   - Add unit tests for security edge cases
   - Implement fuzzing tests for input validation
   - Create security regression test suite

### üìã Medium Priority (Next 90 Days)

3. **Audit Logging Implementation**
   - Add structured security event logging
   - Implement audit trail for all Git operations
   - Create security metrics and monitoring

4. **Input Sanitization Enhancement**
   - Additional output sanitization for terminal formatting
   - Enhanced validation for edge cases
   - Implement content security policies

5. **Configuration Hardening**
   - Add configuration validation schemas
   - Implement secure defaults for all settings
   - Enhanced credential management

### üîÆ Long-term Enhancements (Next 6 Months)

6. **Security Framework Integration**
   - Implement comprehensive security middleware
   - Add authentication and authorization layers
   - Create security policy enforcement

7. **Advanced Threat Protection**
   - Rate limiting for Git operations
   - Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
   - Security monitoring and alerting

8. **Architecture Security**
   - Consider sandboxing for Git operations
   - Implement process isolation
   - Add container security if deploying as service

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation
- All user inputs validated using strict regex patterns
- Path traversal attempts blocked at multiple layers
- Input length limits prevent DoS attacks
- Commit hashes and dates sanitized before processing

### Configuration Management
- Sensitive configuration files excluded from version control
- Environment variables used for all secrets and credentials
- Configuration validation enforced before application startup
- Example templates provided for secure setup

### Network Security
- HTTPS enforced for all webhook URLs and external communications
- SSL certificate validation mandatory for all requests
- Proper timeout handling prevents hanging connections
- Network requests include security headers where applicable

### Process Security
- All subprocess calls use validated, parameterized inputs
- Process timeouts prevent resource exhaustion
- Error handling prevents information leakage
- Security boundaries enforced at system level

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### Preferred Reporting Methods
1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Security" tab to report privately
2. **Direct Email**: Contact maintainers directly for sensitive issues
3. **Encrypted Communication**: PGP keys available upon request
